# GrowthShare Study

GrowthShare is project to build a custom mobile application that can be used by patients with bone dysplasias to record their growth data (ie. height), to plot growth on charts appropriate for their conditions, and to share with our research investigators in order to build new disease-specific growth charts.

Please read the following statement for more information about the study details.

## Parental Information Statement

### (1) What is this study about?

Your child is invited to take part in a research study about building new disease-specific growth charts.

Your child has been invited to participate in this study because of his/her diagnosis with a bone dysplasia. This Participant Information Statement tells you about the research study. Knowing what is involved will help you decide if you want to let your child take part in the research. Please read this sheet carefully and ask questions about anything that you don’t understand or want to know more about. 

Participation in this research study is voluntary. 

By giving your consent you are telling us that you:
- Understand what you have read.
- Agree for your child to take part in the research study as outlined below.
- Agree to the use of your child’s personal information as described.

### (2)	Who is running the study?

The study is being carried out by the following researchers:
- Andreas Zankl, Professor, University of Sydney
- Po Liu, Medical Student, University of Sydney

### (3)	What will the study involve?

After downloading the application onto your device, you will be asked to enter growth data such as height, weight, and head circumference of your child into the application.

### (4)	How much time will the study take?

Each measurement may take less than 1 minute to complete. As such, the entire study should take approximately 30 minutes provided that you have all the growth data available.

### (5)	Who can take part in the study?

Anyone with a diagnosed bone dysplasia such as achondroplasia can take part in the study. 

### (6)	Does my child have to be in the study? Can they withdraw from the study once they’ve started?

Being in this study is completely voluntary and your child does not have to take part. Your decision whether to let them participate will not affect your/their relationship with the researchers or anyone else at the University of Sydney, now or in the future. 

If you decide to let your child take part in the study and then change your mind later (or they no longer wish to take part), they are free to withdraw from the study at any time. You can withdraw by selecting the toggle in the profile menu in the application. There are no consequences if you choose to withdraw.

Your child’s in-application responses can be withdrawn any time before and after they have submitted the growth data. We will automatically delete any data from our secured facilities once you withdraw consent from the application.

### (7)	Are there any risks or costs associated with being in the study?

Aside from giving up their time, we do not expect that there will be any risks or costs associated with taking part in this study for your child.

### (8)	Are there any benefits associated with being in the study?

We cannot guarantee that your child will receive any direct benefits from being in the study.

### (9)	What will happen to information that is collected during the study?

By providing your consent, you are agreeing to us collecting personal information about your child for the purposes of this research study. Their personal information will only be used for the purposes outlined in this Participant Information Statement, unless you consent otherwise.

Your child’s information will be stored securely and their identity/information will be kept strictly confidential, except as required by law. Study findings may be published, but your child will not be individually identifiable in these publications.

We will keep the information we collect for this study, and we may use it in future projects. By providing your consent you are allowing us to use your child’s information in future projects. We don’t know at this stage what these other projects will involve. We will seek ethical approval before using the information in these future projects.

### (10)	Can I or my child tell other people about the study?

Yes, you are welcome to tell other people about the study.

### (11)	What if we would like further information about the study?

When you have read this information, Prof Andreas Zankl will be available to discuss it with you further and answer any questions you may have. If you or your child would like to know more at any stage during the study, please feel free to contact Prof Andreas Zankl at his email andreas.zankl@sydney.edu.au.

### (12)	Will we be told the results of the study?

You and your child have a right to receive feedback about the overall results of this study. You can tell us that you wish to receive feedback by selecting the toggle in the application in the profile menu. This feedback will be in the form of an application update where you may receive our latest published growth charts for specific diseases. You may also opt for an email summary of our results. You will receive this feedback after the study is finished.

### (13)	What if we have a complaint or any concerns about the study?

Research involving humans in Australia is reviewed by an independent group of people called a Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC). The ethical aspects of this study have been approved by the HREC of the University of Sydney [INSERT protocol number once approval is obtained]. As part of this process, we have agreed to carry out the study according to the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007). This statement has been developed to protect people who agree to take part in research studies.

If you (or your child) are concerned about the way this study is being conducted or wish to make a complaint to someone independent from the study, please contact the university using the details outlined below. Please quote the study title and protocol number.
